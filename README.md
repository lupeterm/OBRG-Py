# OBRG-Py
Python implementation of Vo et al.'s paper "Octree-based region growing for point cloud segmentation"

The paper can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271615000283

I am not affiliated with the authors.

This implementation is not optimized in any way, optimizations and recommendations are welcome.

To achieve any sort of real-time applicability, an implementation in C++ would be useful (future work, if anything, though).
